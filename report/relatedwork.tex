\chapter{Related Work}

Describe the other's work in the field, with the following purposes in mind:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Is the overview concise?} Give an overview of the most relevant work to the needed extent. Make sure the reader can understand your work without referring to other literature.
 \item \textit{Does the compilation of work help to define the ``niche'' you are working in?} Another purpose of this section is to lay the groundwork for showing that you did significant work. The selection and presentation of the related work should enable you to name the implications, differences and similarities sufficiently in the ``discussion'' section.
\end{itemize}
